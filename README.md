# loginapplication
Here i did small dynamic application using servlets where a person can login to page using his / her user name and password . 
If user name and password are in database it shows login successful then if we click "ok" on panal it redirects to login page again .
If user is not found automatically it enters that data into database and redirects to login page again for login .
